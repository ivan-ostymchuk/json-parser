## Json Parser

To get familiarity with the Lexing & Parsing pattern I decided to implement my own Json Parser in Golang.
This is one of the many useful coding challenges you can find on:
https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-json-parser

I wanted to practice the Lexing & Parsing pattern (and using some good old recursion)
because it will be very helpful for the next project I'm already working on.
I'll build a tool in which one of the steps will be parsing Sql code.

This Parser works well and covers most of the general cases. Probably there are still some edge cases I didn't think about.
But as I've already said my goal wasn't to create the best parser in the world.
